### ðŸ”¹ **1\. Digital Derivatives: Why Use Differences?**

In continuous math, a derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. But in **digital images**, which are **discrete**, we canâ€™t take a true derivative. So we use **finite differences** to approximate them.

An image is essentially a 2D function f(x,y)f(x, y)f(x,y), where each value represents **intensity** at pixel coordinates (x,y)(x, y)(x,y).

### ðŸ”¹ **2\. First Derivative (Edge Detection)**

The **first derivative** tells us where the image intensity changes sharply â€” like edges.

#### Requirements:

*   âœ… **Zero in constant regions** (no change in intensity â†’ no edge)
    
*   âœ… **Nonzero at the start of an intensity step or ramp** (abrupt change â†’ edge detected)
    
*   âœ… **Nonzero along a ramp** (gradual change â†’ still a detectable gradient)
    

#### Example Approximation:

### ðŸ”¹ **3\. Second Derivative (Edge Localization and Enhancement)**

The **second derivative** highlights regions where the rate of change itself changes â€” e.g., transitions between smooth and abrupt intensity changes.

#### Requirements:

*   âœ… **Zero in constant regions** (flat â†’ no curvature)
    
*   âœ… **Nonzero at the onset and end of an edge or ramp** (where change starts/stops)
    
*   âœ… **Zero along a ramp** (constant slope â†’ no curvature)
    

#### Example Approximation:

### ðŸ”¹ **4\. Digital Nature of Images**

Since digital images are:

*   Made of **finite intensity values** (e.g., 0â€“255 in grayscale), and
    
*   Changes occur over **discrete steps** (from one pixel to the next),
    

ðŸ‘‰ **The smallest distance** over which a change can be detected is **between two adjacent pixels**.So, all derivative approximations are based on differences **between neighboring pixel intensities**.
