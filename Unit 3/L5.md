# Gradient-based approach to edge detection

### ðŸ”· **Gradient in Image Processing**

The **gradient** of a digital image f(x,y)f(x, y)f(x,y) at a point (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) is a **vector**:

### ðŸ”· **Magnitude of the Gradient (Edge Strength)**

The **magnitude** of this vector tells us the **strength of the edge** at that location:

### ðŸ”· **Direction of the Gradient (Edge Orientation)**

The **direction** (or angle Î¸\\thetaÎ¸) of the gradient vector is:

This gives the **orientation of the edge** â€” it tells you **which way the edge is pointing**.

### ðŸ”· **Geometrical Insight**

*   The **gradient vector** always points in the direction of **maximum rate of change** of intensity.
    
*   This means it is **perpendicular (normal)** to the edge itself.
    
*   That's why it's also called the **edge normal**.
    
*   Conversely, the edge lies **along the direction of minimal intensity change**, i.e., **orthogonal to the gradient**.
